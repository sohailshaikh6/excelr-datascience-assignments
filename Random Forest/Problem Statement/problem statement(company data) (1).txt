Let’s consider a Company dataset with around 10 variables and 400 records. 
The attributes are as follows:

 Income -- Community income level (in thousands of dollars)
 Advertising -- Local advertising budget for company at each location (in thousands of dollars)
 Population -- Population size in region (in thousands)
